# Advent of Code 2024

Despite being a programmer for quite a few years now and working with the JVM on a daily basis (since Scala is my main
programming language), I've never actually actively developed anything in Java. Not even an original "Hello, world".

Unfortunately, every once in a while, I have to interact with some Java code, mostly in the form of source code for
libraries and frameworks that I use through Scala ([Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) being a notable example).

To combat my fear of the unknown, I've decided to familiarize myself with the original Beast‚Ñ¢Ô∏èand write my solutions to
this year's Advent of Cod in Java. Wish me luck.

Built with Java 23.

## Starting a new day üåû

To automatically create a new solution for the day, run the following command:

```bash
make
```

To create a new solution for a specific day, run the following command:

```bash
make DAY=3
```

It will also download the input for the day using [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli).

## Execution times üèéÔ∏è

Measured on an M1 Macbook Pro. Compilation time is not included.

If some additional setup for both parts was used before solving them, it will be included in the `Total running time`
column.
